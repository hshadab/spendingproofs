    /// # Arguments
    /// * `model_inputs` - A slice of [`Tensor<Fp>`] representing the input data for the model.
    ///   Each tensor in this slice should correspond to one of the model's input nodes, and must

    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// Returns a [`Result<ForwardResult, Box<dyn Error>>`] where:

    ///     - `outputs`: The output tensors produced by the model (in the order of the model's outputs).
    ///     - `max_lookup_inputs`/`min_lookup_inputs`: The maximum and minimum values encountered as inputs to any lookup operation during execution (useful for quantization or table sizing).
    /// - If an error occurs (e.g., shape mismatch, missing node, or execution failure), returns an error describing the issue.
    ///
    /// # How It Works (Step by Step)
    /// 1. **Prepare Results Map:** Initializes a map to store the output tensors of each node as the graph is executed.
    /// 2. **Reshape and Insert Inputs:** Reshapes each provided input tensor to match the expected input shape, and inserts it into the results map keyed by the input node index.
    /// 3. **Node Execution Loop:** Iterates through each node in the graph in topological order:
    ///     - Gathers the required input tensors for the node from the results map.
    ///     - Executes the node's operation (or recursively executes subgraphs for control flow nodes).
    ///     - Tracks min/max values for lookup operations.
    ///     - Stores the node's output(s) in the results map.
    /// 4. **Collect Outputs:** After all nodes have been executed, collects the output tensors corresponding to the model's output nodes.
    /// 5. **Return Results:** Packages the outputs and lookup statistics into a `ForwardResult` and returns it.
    ///
    /// # When to Use
    /// Use this function whenever you need to:
    /// - Simulate model inference on sample data (e.g., for testing or debugging).
    /// - Validate that the model conversion from ONNX to the internal graph representation is correct.
    /// - Extract intermediate or final outputs for further analysis.
    ///
    /// # Example Usage
    /// ```ignore
    /// let model = Model::new(&mut onnx_file, &run_args);
    /// let input_tensors = vec![...]; // Prepare input tensors matching model's input shapes
    /// let result = model.forward(&input_tensors)?;
    /// println!("Model outputs: {:?}", result.outputs);

    /// # Notes
    /// - Input tensors must be in the correct order and shape.

    pub fn forward(&self, model_inputs: &[Tensor<i32>]) -> Result<ForwardResult, Box<dyn Error>> {
        // A map that stores the output tensors of each node in the computation graph.
        //
        // # Purpose
        // `results` is used to keep track of the intermediate and final outputs produced by each node
        // (identified by their unique index) during the execution of the model. The key is a reference to
        // the node's index (`&usize`), and the value is a vector of `Tensor<Fp>`, representing the output
        // tensors generated by that node.
        //
        // # Why we need `results`
        // In a computational graph, nodes may depend on the outputs of previous nodes. By storing the
        // results in a `BTreeMap`, we can efficiently retrieve the outputs of any node as needed for
        // subsequent computations. This structure also ensures deterministic iteration order, which can be
        // important for reproducibility and debugging.
        //
        // # Usage
        // - When a node is executed, its output tensors are inserted into `results` under its index.
        // - When another node requires the output of a previous node, it can look up the corresponding
        //   entry in `results`.
        // - After the entire graph has been executed, `results` contains the outputs of all nodes, which
        //   can be used for further processing or for extracting the final model outputs.
        //
        // DESIGN NOTE: Why use `BTreeMap<&usize, Vec<Tensor<Fp>>>` for `results`?
        //
        // 1. Why a BTreeMap?
        //    - Deterministic ordering: BTreeMap iterates in sorted order, which helps with reproducibility and debugging.
        //    - Efficient lookup: We need to quickly retrieve the output(s) of any node by its index.
        //    - Nodes are indexed by their unique usize index in the graph.
        //
        // 2. Why does the value type store a Vec<Tensor<Fp>> instead of just Tensor<Fp>?
        //    - Some nodes (especially subgraphs or nodes with multiple outputs) can produce multiple output tensors.
        //    - The Vec allows us to store all outputs for a node, indexed by their outlet (output slot).
        //    - For most nodes, this Vec will have a single element, but for nodes with multiple outputs, each output is stored at its respective index.
        //
        // 3. How do you use this map to get the output of a node?
        //    - To get the output tensor(s) of node 10, you would do:
        //        `let outputs = results.get(&10);`
        //      - If you want the first output (most common case): `let output = &outputs[0];`
        //      - If the node has multiple outputs, you can access them by their outlet index: `let output = &outputs[outlet_index];`
        //
        // 4. Why is the key a reference (&usize) instead of just usize?
        //    - This is because we often have references to node indices from elsewhere in the graph, and using references avoids unnecessary copies.
        //    - BTreeMap allows lookups with either &usize or usize, but here the code is consistent with using references.
        //
        // 5. Summary:
        //    - This structure allows us to efficiently store and retrieve all intermediate and final outputs of the computation graph,
        //      supporting both single-output and multi-output nodes, and ensuring deterministic iteration order.

        // # Intent
        // This line obtains the dimensions (shapes) of each input tensor that the model expects,
        // which is essential for validating input data, constructing subsequent layers, and ensuring
        // compatibility throughout the model's execution.
        //
        // # Why it's needed
        // Knowing the input shapes is crucial for tasks such as input validation, dynamic graph construction,
        // and for informing downstream operations about the expected data structure. It helps prevent
        // runtime errors due to shape mismatches and is often required when exporting, tracing, or
        // transforming the model.
        //
        // # How it's used
        // The returned `input_shapes` value is typically used to:
        // - Validate that provided input data matches the model's requirements.
        // - Dynamically allocate memory or buffers for inputs.
        // - Inform other components or tools (e.g., ONNX exporters, tracers) about the model's input signature.
        //
        // # When it's used
        // This is usually called during model initialization, tracing, or before running inference,
        // whenever the input specification of the model needs to be known or verified.

        //
        // # Why this code is needed
        // The model's forward execution relies on a map (`results`) that holds the output tensors of each node.
        // For input nodes, we must provide the actual input tensors supplied by the user, but these may need to be reshaped
        // to match the expected dimensions as defined by the model (e.g., to handle batch size or symbolic shapes).
        //
        // # Intent
        // This code ensures that each input tensor provided to the model is reshaped to the correct shape and then
        // inserted into the results map under the corresponding input node index. This allows subsequent nodes in the
        // computation graph to retrieve the correct input data during execution.
        //
        // # How it works
        // - Iterates over all input node indices and their corresponding position in the input tensor list.
        // - For each input:
        //     - Clones the provided input tensor.
        //     - Reshapes it to match the expected shape for that input node.
        //     - Inserts the reshaped tensor into the `results` map under the input node's index.

                // different from executing a standard node (NodeType::Node). Subgraphs are used for control flow

                // multiple times with varying inputs (e.g., sequence processing, RNNs).
                //
                // Why is this needed?
                // - Standard nodes perform a single computation given their inputs.
                // - Subgraph nodes encapsulate an entire model that must be executed repeatedly, often with sliced or
                //   stateful inputs, and may have complex input/output mappings.
                // - This code ensures correct iteration, input slicing, state management, and output collection for
                //   subgraph execution.
                //
                // Intent & Purpose:
                // - To simulate the iterative execution of a subgraph as required by ONNX control flow semantics.
                // - To correctly map parent graph inputs to subgraph inputs, handle state variables, and collect outputs.
                // - To recursively execute the subgraph and aggregate results, including lookup statistics.
                //
                // How it works (Step-by-Step):
                // 1. Clone the original inputs and input mappings for reference.
                // 2. Determine the number of iterations required by inspecting the input mappings and dimensions.
                //    (For example, if an input is chunked along an axis, the number of iterations is dim_size / chunk_size.)
                // 3. For each iteration:
                //    a. Slice or update the inputs as specified by the input mappings (e.g., Stacked inputs get a chunk).
                //    b. Recursively call `model.forward(&inputs)` to execute the subgraph for this iteration.
                //    c. Track min/max lookup values from subgraph execution for quantization/table sizing.
                //    d. Map subgraph outputs back to parent graph outputs using output mappings, handling stacking
                //       (concatenation) and state variables.
                //    e. Update stateful inputs for the next iteration using output states.
                // 4. After all iterations, insert the aggregated outputs into the parent graph's results map.
                //
                // Key differences from normal node execution:
                // - Iterative: Subgraphs may execute multiple times, while normal nodes execute once.
                // - Input/Output Mapping: Inputs/outputs may be sliced, stacked, or carried as state, requiring complex mapping.
                // - Recursion: Subgraph execution is recursive, calling `forward` on the sub-model.
                // - State Management: Handles state variables that persist across iterations.
                // - Output Aggregation: May need to concatenate outputs across iterations (stacked outputs).
                //
                // Gotchas:
                // - Input slicing must match the expected chunk size and axis; mismatches can cause runtime errors.
                // - State variables must be correctly updated between iterations.
                // - Output mappings can be complex; ensure correct outlet and axis handling.
                // - Recursion can lead to stack overflows if subgraphs are deeply nested.
                //

        // After executing all nodes in the computational graph, we need to extract the final outputs of the model.
        // The model's outputs are defined as specific nodes (and their output slots) in the graph.
        // This code gathers those outputs from the `results` map, which contains the outputs of every node.
        //
        // # What it does
        // - Iterates over the list of output node indices and outlet slots (`self.graph.outputs`).
        // - For each output, retrieves the corresponding tensor from the `results` map.
        // - Collects all output tensors into a vector, preserving the order defined by the model's outputs.
        // - Wraps the outputs and lookup statistics into a `ForwardResult` struct.
        //
        // # How it works
        // - Uses `.map()` to iterate over each output node and outlet.
        // - Looks up the node's outputs in the `results` map using the node index.
        // - Selects the correct output tensor by indexing into the vector with the outlet index.
        // - Handles missing results by returning a `GraphError`.
        // - Collects all outputs into a `Vec<Tensor<Fp>>`.
        //
        // # Intent

///
/// - Encapsulates the entire computational graph, including all nodes and their relationships.
/// - Clearly separates the graph's structure (nodes) from its entry points (inputs) and exit points (outputs).

/// `InputMapping` is used to specify how the inputs to a subgraph are fed from the outer graph.
/// This is essential for handling ONNX control flow operators like Scan, Loop, or custom subgraphs,
/// where each input may be treated differently (e.g., as a state variable, as a full tensor, or as a chunked/stacked input).
///
/// # Variants
/// - `Full`: The entire input tensor is passed as-is to the subgraph input.
/// - `State`: The input acts as a state variable, typically carried across iterations (e.g., hidden state in RNNs).
/// - `Stacked { axis, chunk }`: The input is split along the specified `axis` into chunks of size `chunk`,
///   and each chunk is fed to the subgraph in each iteration (used for sequence processing).
///
/// # Role in the Codebase
/// `InputMapping` is crucial for correctly wiring up subgraphs during model parsing and execution.
