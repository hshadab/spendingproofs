#[cfg(test)]
use crate::jolt::{bytecode::JoltONNXBytecode, trace::JoltONNXCycle};

/// This function validates that the execution trace matches the expected memory
/// operations by simulating the execution and checking that reads and writes
/// occur at the correct memory addresses with the expected values.
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// This validation is crucial because runtime sometimes converts operands to
/// floating point for intermediate calculations, which can cause mismatches
/// between expected outputs and actual trace values. This function helps catch
/// such discrepancies during testing.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `bytecode` - The sequence of Jolt ONNX bytecode instructions
/// * `execution_trace` - The corresponding execution trace cycles
/// * `memory_size` - The size of the memory space (number of memory addresses)
///
/// # Validation Process
///
/// For each instruction-cycle pair:
/// 1. Validates that ts1 and ts2 reads match the current memory state
/// 2. Validates that td pre-write value matches current memory at td address
/// 3. Updates memory with the td post-write value
///
/// # Panics
///
/// This function will panic with detailed error information if any memory
/// operation doesn't match the expected values, including:
/// - The cycle number where the error occurred
/// - The instruction and cycle details
/// - Expected vs actual values
/// - The memory address involved
///
/// # Example Error Output
///
/// ```text
/// TS1 READ error at cycle_42: <instruction> <cycle>; Expected: 123, got: 456 at address 78
/// ```
